# Tenor-Saxophone

Like the alto saxophone, the tenor saxophone is great for beginners due to it's simplicity. However, the tenor saxophone is also much bigger and heavier meaning that children will have a much tougher time playing the instrument. The tenor saxophone is also much harder for a person to carry regularly due to its weight, thus making traveling much harder. From my experience, walking from school to school to play a concert can sometimes be annoying as your hands start to get tired after 15 to 20 minutes.

The payout of sacrificing weight and size from a tenor saxophone is the sound difference. The tenor saxophone has a medium-low pitched sound, whereas the alto saxophone has a medium-high pitched sound. This causes a distinction in the parts that each instrument plays, as both instruments have their shining moments.

For kids, the alto saxophone is going to be much more popular due to its relatively small size, combined with its weight. However, for the older audience, it is mostly dependent on what kind of sound you like best. Whether it is the high pitched sound of the alto saxophone, or the low pitched sound of the tenor saxophone. I recommend checking both out in person to see which sound you like best before making a decision.
